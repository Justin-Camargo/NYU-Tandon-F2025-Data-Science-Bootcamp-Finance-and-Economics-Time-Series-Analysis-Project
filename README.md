# NYU-Tandon-F2025-Data-Science-Bootcamp-Finance-and-Economics-Time-Series-Analysis-Project
Problem Statement:

The financial markets and global economy are highly interconnected, with indicators such as GDP growth, inflation, interest rates, and stock prices influencing one another in complex ways. Understanding these relationships and forecasting their future movements are critical for informed decision-making by policymakers, investors, and businesses.
The goal of this project is to analyze and model the Finance & Economics Dataset (2000â€“2008) to uncover trends, correlations, and predictive patterns across economic and financial indicators.

Tasks:
-	Dataset Exploration:
    -	Analyze the structure, time range, and key variables (GDP, inflation, interest rates, stock data, etc.).
    -	Identify missing values, anomalies, and outliers that may affect analysis.
  
-	Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:
    -	Handle missing or inconsistent data using interpolation, forward/backward fill, or transformations.
    -	Ensure consistent time indexing and align multiple indicators to a common frequency (daily/monthly/quarterly).
  
-	Feature Engineering:
    -	Create derived variables such as returns, moving averages, volatility, spreads, and lagged features.
    -	Apply transformations (e.g., log returns, differencing, seasonal adjustments) to stabilize series.
  
-	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
    -	Visualize long-term trends and seasonal patterns in economic indicators.
    -	Generate correlation matrices and cross-correlation plots to identify relationships among variables.
  
-	Forecasting Model Development:
    -	Implement baseline models (ML) for univariate forecasting.
    -	Build advanced models (VAR for multivariate, LSTM/GRU for deep learning approaches).
  
-	Model Evaluation:
    -	Assess performance using MAE, RMSE, and MAPE for prediction accuracy.
    -	Compare model results across different indicators to identify best approaches.
  
-	Visualization of Insights:
    -	Create time-series plots, decomposition charts, and heatmaps for economic indicators.
    -	Develop comparative plots showing actual vs predicted values with confidence intervals.
  
-	Dashboard / Interface (Optional):
    -	Build an interactive dashboard (Streamlit/Gradio/Dash) for users to explore data and forecasts.
    -	Include filters to select variables, time periods, and forecast horizons dynamically.

This project will provide hands-on experience with building recommendation systems, enhancing understanding of machine learning, feature engineering, and data visualization techniques. The developed system will serve as a foundation for future improvements and real-world applications.
